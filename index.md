# Interactive Resume

This will be my first project using what I learned for basic web development. This will be used for my capstone class

### Professional Self-Assessment

Before this program, I was originally going for a Chemical Engineering degree with a focus in Biological Engineering. I was able to work as a Pharmacy Technician for a bit to get my foot into the door. It took me a really long time to finally decide to switch majors as it was a hard decision for me, but I was not doing as well as I wanted to in that program. I finally found SNHU and looked at their program. That’s when I started looking into computer science and finally made the switched and transferred over to their online program! When I first started the program, my goal was to be able to work in the video game industry focusing on languages such as C++ and python. I also took game development courses as well. While they were fun, and I thoroughly enjoyed the classes, I found out about web development. I started looking further into it and took some classes on Udemy. There, I found out that this may be something that I will enjoy working with. So, I began working towards that and learning web development skills every chance I get in between classes. Choosing the interactive resume to work on and enhance, truly allowed me to look further and build off what I learned about HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc. This will allow me to do further research and give me more practice on everything all together. 

### Coursework throughout the program

Taking this course allowed me to learn many things about the subject I am interested and also learn more things about myself that I thought I was not capable of. By working through my ePortfolio, it allowed me to see and understand what my weaknesses were. It allowed me to further look into where I struggled, which was the database area, but it forced me to learn how to implement this feature into my project. Even though it may not be perfect quality, I was still able to understand the basics of it.  Throughout the entirety of the program – may be an unpopular opinion – school only taught me the very basics and not really go into depth. I learned very late that in order to keep those skills in grasp, was to learn even more outside of school and expand upon it. I often went to w3schools or mdndocuments, which are both very helpful documentation. 

As for collaborating in a team environment, almost all the classes involved a weekly discussion and some, work in team environments remotely. The weekly discussions I found quite helpful, as it shows you where everyone is and what all the different opinions are, and you are required to interact with other members of the course. In the course where we had to interact with a team, my first experience was to make a jukebox and make changes on bitbucket,I believe this was my team collaboration course. Here I learned about git. I was very confused at first and my first time learning about version control. But with more practice, I was able to understand a bit more. In my game development course was where teamwork was very necessary. We needed to use bitbucket, sourcetree, and we also had two weekly meetings/voice chat on discord to discuss what needs to be done for the week. This class truly showcased my abilities to work with other teammates very well as our end product was amazing. We often communicated to the team of what we are working on and even put down tasks for the week that should be done before pushing any changes. This course was by far the most teamwork I have ever done in the program, so I really enjoyed this one the most. 

Another course that I would like to discuss is my Mongodb class. I was utterly lost in the class and struggled with it but still managed to understand most of the concepts. This was the reason why I decided to go back to it and incorporate that into my project. This gave me a challenge which was what I wanted. Here I learned so many great things that I was never able to get into during the class. I learned about how to implement it in my project using the hyper terminal, mongoose, express, node.js, build upon my Javascript skills, HTTP request and response, and much more! So, in the end, I am glad that I went back and chose this database to work with. Of course, I will still need to practice more in this area on newer projects.

While I did not mention other courses, I still had a great time taking them. What I know now is that I definitely don't want to be in a management role. What I do want to look into more is backend development. My inital goal is to be a frontend developer and eventually a fullstack developer after I learn all the key concepts. I'm glad I was able to get a start at SNHU and figure out what I wanted to do along the way. The only regret I have is that I wish I had started sooner or switched my major a lot sooner. 



## Refinement Plan and Code review

### Category One: Software Engineering/Design
  The artifact that I will be choosing is something that I learned outside of school using only HTML and CSS. When the project was first made, it was just a simple one-page resume with very minimal design. For this part of the project – the designing aspect, I wanted to design it to make it more appealing, such as an interactive resume, where the user will be able to navigate to different sections - such as a contact me page. I would like to add a carousel slide that contains an "About me" section, skills, and education. I will mainly be using what I learned outside of school in a web development bootcamp that I am taking. I plan to use that knowledge and expand upon it since the current webpage needs more work. 
  
### Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures
  For this section, I will be applying what I learned from CS-250: Software development lifecycle. This class went into depth about scrum master, testers, product owners, and developers. Each week we were to take on different roles and see a different standpoint of each title. While doing so, we created test cases to test against the planned outcome. This will be useful for me in the future as it will remind me to write out a rough draft or checklist of what needs to be done or implemented into the project.


### Category Three: Databases
  For this part of the project I plan on using what I learned from my mongoDB course. This was a course that I struggled in so I wanted to take on the challenge and incorporate it into my project. To include it, I plan on adding some type of form to the contact me page, where the user will have to fill out information such as their first name, last name, and email. Upon submitting, their information will be stored into a database. This section will allow me to look into Javascript, node.js, mongoose, express, etc. So, there are a lot of new topics for me to review in order to get started on this. 
  
### Code review
This code review was how the project initially looked like. I went into some detail of what I wanted to implement into the project and discuss how I can write cleaner code. I did not make a new code review because I would like to reference this one and see what I was able and not able to implement in the final submission.

### Enhancement One: Software Engineering and Design

  The artifact that I have chosen was something I worked on outside of school in a web development bootcamp. I never took any web development course at SNHU so I thought it would be interesting to look into. At the start of the project, it began with only a one-page site that only included, some things about me and my experiences. This was created some time in the middle of July of 2020. 
I decided to choose this artifact because I wanted to build upon it. I created it using only HTML and CSS, so it is not the interesting so far. By choosing to enhance this, I would imagine that I will run into some challenges - by going through these challenges, it will allow me to further understand a certain concept. I've been working towards building an ePortfolio for some time now so this will give me the perfect opportunity to do so, which was why I decided to choose this project. 
Some changes that I made so far - since I had already divided the page into sections (divs/containers), for the second container, I had changed that into a carousel slider. In the slider, it contains - "About me", "Experiences", and "Skills". The slider will move on its own once the user interacts with it. Previous and next buttons were added to it in case they want to review the slides again. I had also added a navigation bar that contains a dropdown menu - This menu includes "Contact me, about me, and Experience". When clicking on each of the items, it will bring the user down to the corresponding links using an anchor tag. Next, I created a button that will bring the user to another page - here it will allow the user to fill out a form that will be saved into a database. This will be covered in detail more in the database enhancement section.

### Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures

  For this section, I will be applying what I learned from CS-250: Software development lifecycle. This class went into depth about scrum master, testers, product owners, and developers. Each week we were to take on different roles and see a different standpoint of each title. While doing so, we created test cases to test against the planned outcome. This will be useful for me in the future as it will remind me to write out a rough draft or checklist of what needs to be done or implemented into the project.
I did not originally have an artifact chosen for this part of the project, so I needed to come up with something for that. So I attempted to create a form page where users would be able to email me. After the user inputs their information, the data will be stored into a database - I will get more into this on the database enhancement section. I chose this artifact as a way for me to learn something and build upon it. Although I struggled, I am learning by making mistakes and then going back and fixing said mistakes. I decided to use a form when going to the contact me page as a means for people to contact me and to incorporate data structure and algorithm, I will be saving that information into a database – mongodb. Other than that, I did not have much that I needed to include into this portion of the project.
  
### Enhancement Three: Databases
  The database section was definitely where I struggled to grasp the most. Since I started without a database, I had to create a simple sign up page on the contact me page. On the home page, there is a button that will say “contact me” in the footer, this will bring the user to another page. On this page, there is a form that will ask the user to input their first name, last name, then email. This was created very recently, sometime around two-three weeks ago when I needed to implement this into my project based on the feedback. I decided to select this to add to my interactive resume to learn something new. While it may not be useful for my current site, I do plan on using this as a practice and build upon it further. By making a contact form, it allowed me to put what I learned to practice. At first, I only knew how to add the form using HTML, but it was not functional. Not only did I learn how to make it functional, I also learned how to save that information into a database. Learning this was important as it can help me learn some back end development skills.
