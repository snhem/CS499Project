# Interactive Resume

This will be my first project using what I learned for basic web development. This will be used for my capstone class

## Refinement Plan and Code review

### Category One: Software Engineering/Design
  The artifact that I will be choosing is something that I learned outside of school using only HTML and CSS. When the project was first made, it was just a simple one-page resume with very minimal design. For this part of the project – the designing aspect, I wanted to design it to make it more appealing, such as an interactive resume, where the user will be able to navigate to different sections - such as a contact me page. I would like to add a carousel slide that contains an "About me" section, skills, and education. I will mainly be using what I learned outside of school in a web development bootcamp that I am taking. I plan to use that knowledge and expand upon it since the current webpage needs more work. 
  
### Category Two: Algoirthms and Data Structures
  For this section, I will be applying what I learned from CS-250: Software development lifecycle. This class went into depth about scrum master, testers, product owners, and developers. Each week we were to take on different roles and see a different standpoint of each title. While doing so, we created test cases to test against the planned outcome. This will be useful for me in the future as it will remind me to write out a rough draft or checklist of what needs to be done or implemented into the project.


### Category Three: Databases
  For this part of the project I plan on using what I learned from my mongoDB course. This was a course that I struggled in so I wanted to take on the challenge and incorporate it into my project. To include it, I plan on adding some type of form to the contact me page, where the user will have to fill out information such as their first name, last name, and email. Upon submitting, their information will be stored into a database. This section will allow me to look into Javascript, node.js, mongoose, express, etc. So, there are a lot of new topics for me to review in order to get started on this. 

### Enhancement One: Software Engineering and Design

  The artifact that I have chosen was something I worked on outside of school in a web development bootcamp. I never took any web development course at SNHU so I thought it would be interesting to look into. At the start of the project, it began with only a one-page site that only included, some things about me and my experiences. This was created some time in the middle of July of 2020. 
I decided to choose this artifact because I wanted to build upon it. I created it using only HTML and CSS, so it is not the interesting so far. By choosing to enhance this, I would imagine that I will run into some challenges - by going through these challenges, it will allow me to further understand a certain concept. I've been working towards buidling an ePortfolio for some time now so this will give me the perfect opportunity to do so, which was why I decided to choose this project. 
Some changes that I made so far - since I had already divided the page into sections (divs/containers), for the second container, I had changed that into a carousel slider. In the slider, it contains - "About me", "Experiences", and "Skills". The slider will move on its own once the user interacts with it. Previous and next buttons were added to it in case they want to review the slides again. I had also added a navigation bar that contains a dropdown menu - This menu includes "Contact me, aout me, and Experience". When clicking on each of the items, it will bring the user down to the corresponding links using an anchor tag. Next, I created a button that will bring the user to another page - here it will allow the user to fill out a form that will be saved into a database. This will be covered in detail more in the database enhancement section. 

Here is a link to my repository for changes in the html file: [Enhancements](index.html)

### Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures

  For this section, I will be applying what I learned from CS-250: Software development lifecycle. This class went into depth about scrum master, testers, product owners, and developers. Each week we were to take on different roles and see a different standpoint of each title. While doing so, we created test cases to test against the planned outcome. This will be useful for me in the future as it will remind me to write out a rough draft or checklist of what needs to be done or implemented into the project.
  I did not originally have an artifact chosen for this part of the project so I needed to come up with something for that. So I attempted to created a form page where users would be able to email me. After the user inputs their information, the data will be stored into a database - I will get more into this on the database enhancement section. I chose this artifact as a way for me to learn something and build upon it. Although I struggled, I am learning by making mistakes and then going back and fixing said mistakes. I decided to use a form when going to the contact me page as a means for people to contact me and to incorporate data structure and algorithm, I will be saving that information into a database – mongodb. Other than that I did not have much that I needed to include into this portion of the project.
  
### Enhancement Three: Databases
  The database section was definitely where I struggled to grasp the most. Since I started without a database, I had to create a simple sign up page on the contact me page. On the home page, there is a button that will say “contact me” in the footer, this will bring the user to another page. On this page, there is a form that will ask the user to input their first name, last name, then email. This was created very recently, sometime around two-three weeks ago when I needed to implement this into my project based on the feedback. I decided to select this to add to my interactive resume to learn something new. While it may not be useful for my current site, I do plan on using this as a practice and build upon it further. By making a contact form, it allowed me to put what I learned to practice. At first, I only knew how to add the form using HTML, but it was not functional. Not only did I learn how to make it functional, I also learned how to save that information into a database. Learning this was important as it can help me learn some back end development skills.
